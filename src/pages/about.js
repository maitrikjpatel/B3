      <h3>HOME BAKER, ON THE PATH TO BECOME A PASTRY CHEF</h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>It all started with a simple baking project going hilariously wrong. But, I never left my passion for baking and improving my skills.​</p>
      <p>I began my working career as a software engineer.  However, I always had my mind on baking for my family and friends. I often plan my day around what sweet treat I’m going to bake next, and truthfully, often consume most of the batch.</p>
      <p>I’ve spent the last several months experimenting with flavor combinations and gourmet ingredients to perfect moist, flavorful cakes and silky-smooth buttercream. I am so excited to share these little bites of pure deliciousness with you all. There is just nothing like melt in your mouth cake topped with the perfect frosting.</p>
      <p>I absolutely love the reaction of others when they indulge in these desserts and fall in love with cake and cupcakes all over again!</p>
